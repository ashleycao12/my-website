    <h1 class="my-5 font-bogart text-xl md:text-3xl md:leading-normal font-semibold">I'm Ashley, a full stack developer with a background in data analysis. </h1>
    <p class="text-left font-biotif text-gray-500 md:text-lg my-5">I have a strong passion to make things work and create real positive impacts, however tiny, on our planet and people's life. </p>
    <p class="text-left font-biotif text-gray-500 md:text-lg my-5">I started my journey as a marketing graduate. Then I became a programme coordinator, then a data analyst. I taught myself web development along the way. And the opportunity came when I got accepted into Dev Academy. Now I'm a full stack developer. I'm constantly practicing my skills, as well as learning new things by building fun and small projects.</p>
    <p class="text-left font-biotif text-gray-500 md:text-lg my-5">Now I'm looking for new challenges, where I can put my problem solving skill to good use. I want to work in a team with an inclusive culture, where the value of people is emphasised. </p>
    <p class="text-left font-biotif text-gray-500 md:text-lg my-5">Outside of work I spend time on drawing and playing games. </p>
