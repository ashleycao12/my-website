# my-website

## Note
I learned new things along the way when building this website. So you may see some inconsistency like combination of ```<script>``` and ```<script setup>```

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
